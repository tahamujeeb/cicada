Project Cicada by Taha Mujeeb. 

Cicada is the final year project for my undergrad degree. I worked tirelessly for over 6 months in order to build this program. In a nutshell, Cicada allows the HR personnel to create admin accounts and employee records with basic informational particulars. The admin can then assign a tag to each employee based on their experience and performance. It also allows the admin to mark an employee of their status, whether they are active or dismissed whilst allowing multiple filters to be applied based on the employee records.
